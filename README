Comments
========

The bnfos configuration is read out by retrieving
the URL http://bnfos/config.txt.

The config.txt is part of the firmware image. It
should be created using the mkconf binary from the
src/ directory.

The config.txt mime-type has to be set to plain/text
and enabled DHTML in the HTTP_FlashCreator.exe tool.
