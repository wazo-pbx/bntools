res_bnfos - Asterisk Resource Modul for beroNet's bero*fos device

Installation
============

You need to have libbnfos installed.

Build and install:

    make install


Configuration
=============

Open /etc/asterisk/bnfos.conf in your favorite text editor. To get your
bero*fos watchdog setup ready to run, you must set the dev_mac value to
your bero*fos's mac address. You may retrieve the mac address by either
using the command `bnfos --scan`, or by using the Asterisk CLI command
`bnfos scan`.

If your bero*fos device is on a different network (i.e. behind a router),
you also have to set the dev_ip value to the bero*fos's IP address.

The other configuration options are well commented and can be left
unchanged for a start.
